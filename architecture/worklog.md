## 2025-04-22 Testing Optimization\n\n- Added temporary chunk filtering logic to `scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py` (around line 611) to process only a small subset of chunks (Des Moines area) for faster testing.\n- **IMPORTANT:** This filtering block must be removed or commented out before running the pipeline on the full dataset.\n\n## 2024-05-16 Codebase Review & Documentation\n\n- **Goal:** Review existing codebase structure, identify main pipeline components, and establish baseline documentation.\n- **Actions:**\n    - Listed contents of root, `scripts`, `sql`, `utils`, `architecture` directories.\n    - Reviewed root `README.md`, `scripts/README.md`, and `docs/quick_start.md`.\n    - Identified primary workflow: `scripts/reset_database.py --import ...` followed by `scripts/run_pipeline.py` (or `_enhanced.py`). These scripts orchestrate SQL execution (`sql/*.sql`).\n    - Confirmed data loading via `osm2pgsql` is handled by `reset_database.py`.\n    - Confirmed hex grid generation is likely part of `run_pipeline.py` using SQL, not a separate script.\n    - Identified `scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py` as likely deprecated/alternative.\n    - Created initial `architecture/architecture.md` outlining the structure and workflow.\n- **Findings:**\n    - Documentation mismatch: `docs/quick_start.md` describes a more manual SQL-based workflow compared to the Python script-driven approach in other READMEs.\n    - The `scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py` script mentioned in previous worklog entry seems unrelated to the primary documented pipeline.\n- **Next Steps:**\n    - Propose moving `scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py` to `deprecated/`.\n    - Further investigate `run_pipeline.py` vs `run_pipeline_enhanced.py`.\n    - Clarify DEM integration and `osm2pgsql` configuration.\n    - Resume original task (DB clean and pipeline run) once review is complete.
