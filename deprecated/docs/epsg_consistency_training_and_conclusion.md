# CRS Standardization Training Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides an overview of the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) standardization implemented in the Terrain System project. It explains the concepts, benefits, and how to use the new CRS-standardized components.

## What is a Coordinate Reference System?

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) defines how coordinates in a spatial dataset relate to real locations on the Earth's surface. There are many different CRS standards, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

The two most common CRS standards used in our project are:

1. **EPSG:4326 (WGS84)** - Uses latitude and longitude in degrees. This is the standard used by GPS devices and is the most common for data exchange.
2. **EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator)** - A projection used by many web mapping applications (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap). It uses meters as units, which makes it suitable for distance and area calculations.

## Why Standardize on EPSG:3857?

We've standardized on EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) for all internal processing for several reasons:

1. **Metric Units**: EPSG:3857 uses meters as units, which makes it more intuitive for specifying buffer distances, grid cell sizes, and other parameters.
2. **Consistent Calculations**: Using a single CRS throughout the pipeline ensures consistent calculations and reduces the risk of errors from coordinate transformations.
3. **Better Performance**: Reducing the number of coordinate transformations improves performance.
4. **Simplified Code**: Using a consistent CRS makes the code simpler and easier to maintain.

We still use EPSG:4326 (WGS84) for export and visualization, as it's more common for data exchange and is the standard used by most mapping libraries.

## Key Changes

The CRS standardization has been implemented across the entire pipeline:

1. **Water Obstacle Pipeline**: All SQL scripts have been updated to use EPSG:3857 for internal processing.
2. **Terrain Grid and Edges**: New scripts have been created to generate terrain grid and edges in EPSG:3857.
3. **Unified Edges and Topology**: The unified edges and topology scripts have been updated to use EPSG:3857.
4. **Export and Visualization**: The export and visualization scripts have been updated to transform from EPSG:3857 to EPSG:4326 only when needed.

## How to Use the CRS-Standardized Components

### Running the Water Obstacle Pipeline

```bash
# Run the water obstacle pipeline with CRS standardization
python planning/scripts/run_water_obstacle_pipeline_crs.py --config planning/config/crs_standardized_config.json
```

### Running the Unified Pipeline

```bash
# Run the unified pipeline with CRS standardization
python scripts/run_unified_pipeline.py --crs 3857
```

### Exporting a Graph Slice

```bash
# Export a slice with CRS standardization
python tools/export_unified.py --mode graphml --lon -93.63 --lat 41.99 --minutes 60 --crs 3857
```

### Visualizing the Results

```bash
# Visualize with CRS standardization
python visualize_unified.py --mode water --crs 4326
```

## Configuration

The CRS standardization uses a new configuration file, `planning/config/crs_standardized_config.json`, which includes parameters for the CRS-standardized components:

```json
{
    "crs": 3857,
    "water_features": {
        "river_buffer_m": 50,
        "lake_buffer_m": 100,
        "stream_buffer_m": 25
    },
    "terrain_grid": {
        "cell_size": 200,
        "connection_distance": 300
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always specify buffer distances in meters**: When using EPSG:3857, buffer distances should always be specified in meters.
2. **Use the CRS parameter**: Always specify the CRS parameter when running scripts to ensure consistent behavior.
3. **Transform to EPSG:4326 for visualization**: When visualizing data, transform to EPSG:4326 for better compatibility with mapping libraries.
4. **Check SRID metadata**: When creating new tables, always add SRID metadata to ensure proper CRS handling.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Incorrect buffer sizes**: If buffer sizes appear incorrect, check that you're using meters as units and that the CRS is set to EPSG:3857.
2. **Misaligned features**: If features appear misaligned, check that all tables have the same CRS.
3. **Performance issues**: If performance is slow, check that you're not performing unnecessary coordinate transformations.

### Debugging

1. **Check SRID metadata**: Use `SELECT ST_SRID(geom) FROM table_name LIMIT 1` to check the SRID of a geometry column.
2. **Verify transformations**: Use `SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Transform(geom, 4326)) FROM table_name LIMIT 1` to verify that transformations are working correctly.
3. **Run tests**: Use the test scripts in `planning/tests/` to verify that the CRS standardization is working correctly.

## Conclusion

The EPSG consistency implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to standardizing the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) across the entire Terrain System pipeline. By using EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) for all internal processing and EPSG:4326 (WGS84) for export and visualization, we can ensure consistent and accurate spatial operations.

The implementation is divided into several phases:

1. **Terrain Grid and Edges**: Update the terrain grid and edges scripts to use EPSG:3857.
2. **Water Edges and Environmental Tables**: Update the water edges and environmental tables scripts to use EPSG:3857.
3. **Unified Edges and Topology**: Update the unified edges and topology scripts to use EPSG:3857.
4. **Export and Visualization**: Update the export and visualization scripts to transform from EPSG:3857 to EPSG:4326 only when needed.
5. **Testing**: Create unit tests and integration tests to verify the CRS standardization.
6. **Integration with Existing Code**: Update the existing code to support CRS standardization.
7. **Documentation and Training**: Create documentation and training materials for the team.

The implementation will be completed over a 4-week period, with each phase building on the previous one. The result will be a more robust, accurate, and maintainable pipeline that can handle spatial operations consistently across different geographic regions.

### Benefits

The CRS standardization provides several benefits:

1. **Improved accuracy**: Using EPSG:3857 for internal processing ensures that all spatial operations are performed in a metric coordinate system, which is more accurate for distance and area calculations.
2. **Consistent buffer sizes**: Buffer sizes are now specified in meters, which is more intuitive and consistent across different latitudes.
3. **Better performance**: Using a single CRS throughout the pipeline reduces the need for coordinate transformations, which can improve performance.
4. **Simplified code**: Using a consistent CRS makes the code simpler and easier to maintain.

### Future Work

While the current implementation provides a solid foundation for CRS standardization, there are several areas for future improvement:

1. **Performance optimization**: Further optimize the SQL queries to improve performance.
2. **Additional CRS support**: Add support for additional CRS standards as needed.
3. **Automated testing**: Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and scenarios.
4. **Documentation improvements**: Continue to improve the documentation and training materials.

By implementing this plan, we will create a more robust, accurate, and maintainable pipeline that can handle spatial operations consistently across different geographic regions.
