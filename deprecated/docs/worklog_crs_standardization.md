## Next Steps

After completing the CRS standardization and Delaunay triangulation projects, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Performance optimization**: Further optimize the SQL queries to improve performance, especially for large datasets.
2. **Additional CRS support**: Add support for additional CRS standards as needed.
3. **Automated testing**: Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and scenarios.
4. **Documentation improvements**: Continue to improve the documentation and training materials.
5. **Triangulation enhancements**: Explore additional enhancements to the Delaunay triangulation approach, such as:
   - Incorporating terrain slope into edge cost calculation
   - Implementing spatial partitioning for large datasets
   - Creating specific visualization tools for the triangulation

## Issues and Challenges

During the CRS standardization and Delaunay triangulation projects, the following issues and challenges were encountered:

1. **Coordinate transformation issues**: Some coordinate transformations resulted in invalid geometries. This was fixed by adding validation steps to ensure valid geometries.
2. **Performance issues**: Some SQL queries were slow due to complex spatial operations. This was fixed by optimizing the queries and adding indexes.
3. **Integration issues**: Some existing code assumed EPSG:4326 for all operations. This was fixed by updating the code to support EPSG:3857.
4. **Testing issues**: Some tests failed due to differences in coordinate precision. This was fixed by adding tolerance parameters to the tests.
5. **Triangulation complexity**: The Delaunay triangulation approach is more computationally expensive than the regular grid approach. This was addressed by optimizing the implementation and filtering out unnecessary points before triangulation.
6. **Edge deduplication**: Edges extracted from the triangulation needed to be deduplicated, as each edge appears in two triangles. This was solved using a sophisticated deduplication approach based on endpoint coordinates.

## Lessons Learned

The CRS standardization and Delaunay triangulation projects provided several valuable lessons:

1. **Importance of consistent CRS**: Using a consistent CRS throughout the pipeline is essential for accurate spatial operations.
2. **Benefits of metric units**: Using a CRS with metric units (EPSG:3857) makes it easier to specify buffer distances and other parameters.
3. **Performance considerations**: Coordinate transformations can be expensive, so it's important to minimize them.
4. **Testing importance**: Comprehensive testing is essential to ensure that CRS standardization works correctly.
5. **Adaptive terrain representation**: The Delaunay triangulation approach provides a more natural and adaptive terrain representation compared to a regular grid.
6. **Boundary adaptation**: Adding points along water buffer boundaries significantly improves the triangulation's ability to follow the contours of water features.
7. **Edge quality**: The edges extracted from the triangulation provide better connectivity and more realistic routing compared to a regular grid.
