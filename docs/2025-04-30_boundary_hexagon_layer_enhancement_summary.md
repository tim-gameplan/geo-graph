# Boundary Hexagon Layer Enhancement Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Boundary Hexagon Layer approach in the EPSG:3857 Terrain Graph Pipeline. The enhancements focus on improving the connectivity between terrain and water obstacle boundaries, addressing issues with duplicate boundary nodes, and creating a more robust unified graph.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Duplicate Boundary Nodes Fix

The boundary nodes were being created twice, once in the `terrain_grid_points` table and once in the `boundary_nodes` table. This was causing duplicate nodes at the same locations, which led to redundant connections and potential pathfinding issues.

**Solution:**
- Modified `05_create_boundary_nodes_hexagon.sql` to use `DISTINCT ON` with `ST_SnapToGrid` to ensure unique boundary nodes.
- This prevents duplicate nodes while maintaining the correct spatial relationships.

### 2. Water Obstacle Graph Creation

The water boundary nodes were not being connected to each other to form a complete water obstacle graph, which limited navigation options along water features.

**Solution:**
- Added a new edge type: `water_boundary_water_boundary_edges` in `06_create_boundary_edges_hexagon.sql`.
- Implemented logic to connect water boundary nodes to each other along the water obstacle boundaries.
- Applied appropriate cost factors for water navigation.

### 3. Direct Boundary-to-Water Connections

Previously, boundary nodes were only connected to water boundary nodes through land portion nodes, creating an indirect path that wasn't optimal for navigation.

**Solution:**
- Added a new edge type: `boundary_water_boundary_edges` in `06_create_boundary_edges_hexagon.sql`.
- Implemented direct connections between boundary nodes and water boundary nodes.
- Added constraints to ensure these connections don't cross through water obstacles.
- Limited the number of connections per boundary node to prevent excessive edge creation.

### 4. Unified Graph Improvements

The unified graph now includes all edge types, providing a more comprehensive representation of the terrain and water obstacle boundaries.

**Solution:**
- Updated the `all_boundary_edges` table to include the new edge types.
- Added appropriate spatial indexes for the new edge tables.
- Enhanced logging to track the creation of all edge types.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Navigation:** Direct connections between boundary nodes and water boundary nodes allow for more efficient pathfinding around water obstacles.

2. **Complete Water Navigation:** The water obstacle graph enables navigation along water features, which is essential for water-based transportation.

3. **Reduced Redundancy:** Eliminating duplicate boundary nodes reduces the graph size and improves performance.

4. **Better Connectivity:** The enhanced connection strategies create a more natural transition between terrain and water obstacle boundaries.

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Testing:** Evaluate the performance impact of the new connection strategies.

2. **Visualization Enhancements:** Update visualization tools to better display the new edge types.

3. **Parameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the connection parameters (max length, max connections per direction) for optimal results.

4. **Integration with Other Approaches:** Consider how these enhancements can be applied to other connection strategies like Voronoi and Reversed Voronoi.
