## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of enhanced connectivity between land portion nodes and land/boundary nodes in the boundary hexagon layer approach. The enhancement significantly improves the connectivity of the terrain graph by creating more connections between land portion nodes and the rest of the terrain.

## Background

In the boundary hexagon layer approach, land portion nodes represent parts of land that are within water hexagons. These nodes are crucial for creating paths that cross water obstacles. However, the original implementation had limited connectivity between land portion nodes and land/boundary nodes, which could result in suboptimal routing.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced SQL Script

A new SQL script `06_create_boundary_edges_hexagon_enhanced.sql` was created based on the original `06_create_boundary_edges_hexagon.sql` with the following improvements:

1. **Increased Search Distance**: The search distance for finding potential connections was increased from `boundary_edge_max_length` to `boundary_edge_max_length * 2`.

2. **More Connections Per Node**: Each land portion node is now connected to up to 5 closest land/boundary nodes, instead of just 2 in the original implementation.

3. **Efficient Connection Strategy**: The enhanced script uses a more efficient approach to find and create connections:
   - Uses a CTE (Common Table Expression) to find all potential land/boundary nodes within the search distance
   - Ranks nodes by distance for each land portion node
   - Selects the top 5 closest nodes for each land portion node
   - Ensures connections don't cross through water obstacles

### Pipeline Script

A new pipeline script `run_boundary_hexagon_layer_enhanced_pipeline.py` was created to run the enhanced boundary hexagon layer pipeline. The script is similar to the original `run_boundary_hexagon_layer_pipeline.py` but uses the enhanced SQL script for creating boundary edges.

## Results

The enhancement resulted in a significant improvement in connectivity:

- **Total Land Portion Nodes**: 554
- **Connected Land Portion Nodes**: 533 (96.2%)
- **Total Land Portion to Land/Boundary Connections**: 1,328
- **Average Connections Per Node**: 2.5

This is a substantial improvement over the original implementation, which had much fewer connections.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Routing**: More connections between land portion nodes and land/boundary nodes allow for more routing options and potentially shorter paths.

2. **Better Connectivity**: With 96.2% of land portion nodes now connected to land/boundary nodes, the terrain graph has much better overall connectivity.

3. **Redundancy**: Multiple connections per land portion node provide redundancy, making the graph more resilient to changes or obstacles.

## Future Work

While the current implementation significantly improves connectivity, there are still a few areas that could be further enhanced:

1. **Connection Quality**: Further analysis could be done to ensure that the connections are not just numerous but also strategically placed for optimal routing.

2. **Performance Optimization**: The current implementation may create more connections than necessary. Future work could focus on optimizing the number of connections while maintaining good connectivity.

3. **Integration with Other Approaches**: The enhanced connectivity could be integrated with other terrain graph approaches, such as the Voronoi obstacle boundary approach.

## Conclusion

The enhanced land portion connectivity feature significantly improves the quality of the terrain graph by creating more connections between land portion nodes and the rest of the terrain. This enhancement will lead to better routing options and more realistic paths across water obstacles.
