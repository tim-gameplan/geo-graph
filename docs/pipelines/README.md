## Current Production Pipeline

The current production pipeline is the Enhanced Boundary Hexagon Layer Pipeline, which is documented in:
- `boundary_hexagon_layer_approach.md`
- `boundary_hexagon_layer_implementation_plan.md`

## Legacy Pipelines

Documentation for legacy pipelines is also included for reference:
