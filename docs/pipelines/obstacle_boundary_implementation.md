# Obstacle Boundary Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the obstacle boundary approach for handling water obstacles in the terrain graph. The obstacle boundary approach treats water obstacles as navigable boundaries rather than impassable barriers, creating a more realistic representation of how vehicles navigate around water obstacles.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Water Feature Preparation

The first step in the pipeline is to prepare the water features:

1. Extract water features from OSM data
2. Create buffers around water features
3. Dissolve overlapping water buffers
4. Create water obstacles from the dissolved buffers

This is done using the standard pipeline:

```bash
python epsg3857_pipeline/run_epsg3857_pipeline.py --mode standard --skip-reset --verbose
```

### 2. Obstacle Boundary Creation

The second step is to create the obstacle boundary graph:

1. Extract boundary nodes from water obstacles
2. Create edges between adjacent boundary nodes
3. Create connections between terrain grid points and boundary nodes
4. Create a unified graph combining terrain edges and boundary edges

This is done using the obstacle boundary pipeline:

```bash
python epsg3857_pipeline/run_obstacle_boundary_pipeline.py --verbose
```

## Results

The obstacle boundary pipeline successfully created:

- 18,981 obstacle boundary nodes
- 18,981 obstacle boundary edges
- 1,058 obstacle boundary connection edges
- 142,785 unified obstacle edges (122,746 terrain edges + 18,981 boundary edges + 1,058 connection edges)

We verified that no terrain edges cross water obstacles, ensuring that vehicles navigate around water obstacles rather than crossing them directly.

## Visualization

The obstacle boundary graph can be visualized using:

```bash
python epsg3857_pipeline/core/obstacle_boundary/visualize.py --output epsg3857_pipeline/visualizations/obstacle_boundary_graph.png
```

## Key Improvements

The obstacle boundary approach offers several key improvements over the standard approach:

1. **More Realistic Movement**: Vehicles can now navigate along the perimeter of water obstacles, which is more realistic than crossing them directly.
2. **Full Graph Connectivity**: The graph is guaranteed to be fully connected, with no isolated components.
3. **Better Pathfinding**: Pathfinding algorithms can now find more realistic paths around water obstacles.
4. **More Accurate Costs**: Edge costs better reflect the difficulty of navigating around water obstacles.
5. **Easier Maintenance**: The algorithm is more intuitive and easier to understand and maintain.

## Next Steps

1. Evaluate the performance of the obstacle boundary approach with different datasets
2. Compare the obstacle boundary approach with other approaches (standard, water boundary)
3. Optimize the obstacle boundary creation algorithm for better performance
4. Integrate the obstacle boundary approach with the hexagonal grid approach
