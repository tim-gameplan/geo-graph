## Use Case Examples

### Urban Planning

**Recommended Approach**: Standard Pipeline or Obstacle Boundary Approach

**Rationale**: Urban areas typically have well-defined water features and require good connectivity. The standard pipeline is efficient for large urban areas, while the obstacle boundary approach provides better connectivity for complex urban water features.

### Navigation Systems

**Recommended Approach**: Water Boundary Approach, Obstacle Boundary Approach, Voronoi Obstacle Boundary, or Reversed Voronoi Obstacle Boundary

**Rationale**: Navigation systems require precise water boundary representation and optimal connectivity. The water boundary approach or obstacle boundary approach provides the best connectivity and most realistic representation of water boundaries. The Voronoi and Reversed Voronoi approaches are particularly useful for navigation systems that require evenly distributed connections to water boundaries, with the Reversed Voronoi approach providing the most natural-looking connections.

### Environmental Analysis

**Recommended Approach**: Delaunay Triangulation

**Rationale**: Environmental analysis often requires a more natural terrain representation. The Delaunay triangulation approach provides the most natural-looking terrain representation and better adaptation to natural features.

### Game Development

**Recommended Approach**: Boundary Hexagon Layer

**Rationale**: Game development often requires a balance between natural appearance and performance. The boundary hexagon layer approach provides a good balance between precision and performance, with no "white space" issues. The land portions of water hexagons and directional connections from land toward water are particularly useful for creating natural-looking pathfinding around water obstacles in games.

## Conclusion

Each pipeline approach has its strengths and limitations. The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements of your project:

- **Standard Pipeline**: Best for general-purpose terrain graph generation and when performance is a priority
- **Water Boundary Approach**: Best when precise water boundary navigation is needed
- **Obstacle Boundary Approach**: Best when clean boundary representation and optimal connectivity are required
- **Hexagon Obstacle Boundary**: Best when natural terrain representation and precise water boundaries are needed
- **Voronoi Obstacle Boundary**: Best when even distribution of connections to water boundaries is important
- **Reversed Voronoi Obstacle Boundary**: Best when most natural-looking connections and robust geometry processing are needed
- **Delaunay Triangulation**: Best when natural terrain representation is a priority (but still experimental)
- **Boundary Hexagon Layer**: Best when "white space" issues need to be addressed and natural transitions between terrain and water obstacles are needed

For most use cases, the standard pipeline with improved water edge creation is recommended as it provides a good balance between performance, connectivity, and stability. However, for more specialized needs, the Hexagon Obstacle Boundary or Voronoi Obstacle Boundary approaches may provide better results, especially for applications requiring natural movement patterns around water obstacles or evenly distributed connections to water boundaries.
