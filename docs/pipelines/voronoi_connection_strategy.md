# Voronoi Connection Strategy

## Overview

The Voronoi Connection Strategy is an approach for connecting terrain grid points to water obstacle boundaries in a more distributed and efficient manner. This document outlines the implementation, challenges, and optimizations made to improve the strategy.

## Implementation

The Voronoi Connection Strategy works by:

1. Creating boundary nodes along water obstacle boundaries
2. Creating a "Voronoi-like" assignment of terrain grid points to boundary nodes
3. Connecting each terrain grid point to its nearest boundary node(s)
4. Creating a unified graph by combining terrain edges, boundary edges, and connection edges

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: True Voronoi Diagram Generation

Initially, we attempted to use PostGIS's `ST_VoronoiPolygons` function to generate true Voronoi diagrams for the boundary nodes. However, this approach encountered geometry errors due to the large number of boundary nodes and complex geometries:

```
ERROR: GEOSVoronoiDiagram: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 2 - must be 0 or >= 4
```

### Solution: Buffer-Based Approach

Instead of using true Voronoi diagrams, we implemented a buffer-based approach:

1. For each boundary node, create a buffer that represents its "cell"
2. Clip the cells to exclude water areas and limit to maximum distance
3. Connect terrain grid points to their nearest boundary node(s)

This approach is more robust and avoids the geometry errors encountered with true Voronoi diagrams.

## Optimizations

### 1. Reduced Buffer Size

We reduced the buffer size for Voronoi cells from 500m to 200m to create smaller, more focused cells. This helps reduce the overlap between cells and creates a more natural-looking connection pattern.

```json
"voronoi_buffer_distance": 200
```

### 2. Reduced Maximum Connection Distance

We reduced the maximum connection distance from 1000m to 500m to limit the range of connections. This helps ensure that terrain grid points are only connected to nearby boundary nodes.

```json
"voronoi_max_distance": 500
```

### 3. Limited Connections Per Terrain Point

We limited each terrain point to connect to only its single nearest boundary node (changed from 2 to 1). This significantly reduces the number of connection edges and creates a cleaner visualization.

```json
"voronoi_connection_limit": 1
```

### 4. Improved Query Efficiency

We implemented a more efficient approach using spatial indexing and pre-filtering:

```sql
-- Create a temporary table with boundary nodes and their buffers
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_boundary_node_buffers AS
SELECT 
    node_id,
    geom,
    ST_Buffer(geom, :voronoi_buffer_distance) AS buffer_geom
FROM 
    obstacle_boundary_nodes;

-- Create spatial index on the buffers
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS temp_boundary_node_buffers_geom_idx 
ON temp_boundary_node_buffers USING GIST (buffer_geom);

-- Find boundary nodes whose buffer contains the terrain point
-- This is much faster than calculating distances to all boundary nodes
SELECT 
    tgp.id AS terrain_id,
    bnb.node_id AS boundary_node_id,
    ST_Distance(tgp.geom, bnb.geom) AS distance
FROM 
    terrain_grid_points tgp
JOIN 
    temp_boundary_node_buffers bnb
ON 
    ST_DWithin(tgp.geom, bnb.geom, :voronoi_max_distance)
    AND ST_Intersects(tgp.geom, bnb.buffer_geom)
```

This approach uses `ST_DWithin` and `ST_Intersects` to pre-filter the boundary nodes, which is much faster than calculating distances to all boundary nodes.

## Results

The optimized Voronoi Connection Strategy produces:

- Smaller, more focused Voronoi cells (200m buffer instead of 500m)
- Fewer connection edges (2,446 edges with 1 connection per terrain point)
- More efficient query execution
- Cleaner visualization with less overlap

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the Voronoi Connection Strategy include:

1. Implementing a clustering approach to group boundary nodes before creating connections
2. Using a spatial index to partition the space more efficiently
3. Implementing a true Voronoi diagram using PostGIS's ST_VoronoiPolygons function, but with smaller subsets of boundary nodes to avoid the geometry errors
4. Adding elevation data to create more realistic terrain modeling
