## Overview

This document describes the unified Delaunay triangulation pipeline for large datasets. This pipeline is designed to process large geographic areas efficiently by:

1. Partitioning the data into manageable spatial chunks
2. Processing each chunk in parallel
3. Merging the results into a unified dataset
4. Optimizing memory usage and performance

The pipeline builds on the EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) standardization and Delaunay triangulation approach to create a more natural and accurate terrain representation.

## Key Features

### Spatial Partitioning

For large datasets, processing the entire area at once can be memory-intensive and slow. The unified pipeline addresses this by:

- Dividing the dataset into spatial chunks based on geographic extent
- Adding overlap between chunks to ensure seamless integration
- Processing each chunk independently
- Merging the results while maintaining topological relationships

### Parallel Processing

To improve performance, the pipeline uses parallel processing:

- Multiple chunks are processed simultaneously using a thread pool
- The number of threads can be configured based on available CPU cores
- Each chunk runs in its own database schema to avoid conflicts
- Progress tracking provides visibility into the processing status

### Memory Optimization

Memory usage is optimized by:

- Processing one chunk at a time per thread
- Using database-native spatial operations
- Cleaning up temporary data after processing
- Implementing efficient data structures and algorithms

### Consistent CRS Usage

The pipeline maintains consistent coordinate reference system usage:

- All internal processing uses EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator)
- Metric-based measurements ensure accurate distance calculations
- Export to EPSG:4326 (WGS84) is handled at the final stage

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL with PostGIS and pgRouting extensions
- Python 3.6+ with required packages (psycopg2, concurrent.futures)
- OSM data imported into the database

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Basic usage with default settings
./scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py

# Specify configuration file
./scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py --config planning/config/crs_standardized_config.json

# Control parallel processing
./scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py --threads 8

# Adjust chunk size (in meters)
./scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py --chunk-size 10000

# Specify SQL directory and database connection
./scripts/run_unified_delaunay_pipeline.py --sql-dir planning/sql --conn-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/gis"
```

### Configuration Options

The pipeline can be configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "buffer_distance": 50,
  "threads": 8,
  "chunk_size": 5000,
  "grid_spacing": 200,
  "boundary_point_spacing": 100
}
```

Key configuration parameters:

- `buffer_distance`: Distance in meters to buffer water features
- `threads`: Number of threads for parallel processing
- `chunk_size`: Size of each spatial chunk in meters
- `grid_spacing`: Spacing between grid points in meters
- `boundary_point_spacing`: Spacing between boundary points in meters

## Pipeline Stages

The unified Delaunay triangulation pipeline consists of the following stages:

### 1. Data Preparation

- Load configuration
- Connect to the database
- Determine the extent of the dataset
- Create spatial chunks with overlap

### 2. Chunk Processing

For each chunk, the following steps are performed in parallel:

- Create a temporary schema for the chunk
- Extract water features within the chunk extent
- Create water buffers
- Dissolve water buffers
- Generate Delaunay triangulation
- Create terrain grid from triangulation centroids
- Extract terrain edges from triangulation
- Create water edges
- Create environmental tables

### 3. Result Merging

After all chunks are processed:

- Merge terrain grid points
- Merge triangulation polygons
- Update edge source/target IDs to reference the merged grid
- Merge terrain and water edges
- Create spatial indexes for efficient querying
- Create unified edges table
- Create topology for routing

### 4. Cleanup

- Remove temporary schemas and tables
- Log processing statistics and completion time

## Performance Considerations

### Chunk Size

The chunk size parameter significantly affects performance:

- Smaller chunks use less memory but create more overhead
- Larger chunks are more efficient but require more memory
- Recommended chunk size: 5-10 km for most datasets

### Thread Count

The optimal number of threads depends on:

- Available CPU cores
- Available memory
- Database performance

For most systems, setting threads equal to the number of CPU cores works well.

### Database Optimization

For optimal performance:

- Ensure the database has sufficient memory
- Create appropriate indexes
- Tune PostgreSQL parameters for spatial operations
- Consider using a dedicated database server for large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Out of memory errors**:
   - Reduce chunk size
   - Reduce the number of threads
   - Increase database memory allocation

2. **Slow processing**:
   - Increase chunk size (if memory allows)
   - Optimize database configuration
   - Check for disk I/O bottlenecks

3. **Chunk processing failures**:
   - Check database logs for errors
   - Ensure PostGIS functions are available
   - Verify data integrity in the problematic area

### Logging

The pipeline generates detailed logs that can help diagnose issues:

- Overall progress and timing information
- Per-chunk processing status
- SQL execution errors
- Memory usage statistics

Logs are saved to the `output/logs` directory with timestamps.

## Integration with Existing Tools

The unified Delaunay triangulation pipeline integrates with other tools in the terrain system:

- **Visualization**: Use `visualize_unified.py --mode delaunay` to visualize the results
- **Testing**: Run `planning/tests/test_delaunay_triangulation.py` to verify the implementation
- **Export**: Use `tools/export_unified.py` to export the results for external use

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the pipeline include:

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Implement GPU-accelerated Delaunay triangulation for even larger datasets
2. **Adaptive Chunking**: Dynamically adjust chunk size based on data density
3. **Distributed Processing**: Extend to multi-node processing for extremely large datasets
4. **Progressive Visualization**: Visualize results as they are processed
5. **Quality Metrics**: Add more comprehensive quality metrics for the triangulation

## Conclusion

The unified Delaunay triangulation pipeline provides a scalable and efficient approach to processing large geographic datasets. By combining spatial partitioning, parallel processing, and memory optimization with the benefits of Delaunay triangulation and consistent CRS usage, it enables the creation of high-quality terrain models for routing and analysis.
