4. [Table Naming Implementation Plan Detailed](table_naming_implementation_plan_detailed.md) - Script-by-script implementation plan
5. [Table Naming Testing Strategy](table_naming_testing_strategy.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy
6. [Table Naming Implementation Timeline](table_naming_implementation_timeline.md) - Detailed timeline with daily tasks
7. [Table Naming Code Reference Updates](table_naming_code_reference_updates.md) - Approach for updating code references
8. [Table Naming Implementation Plan Overview](table_naming_implementation_plan_overview.md) - High-level overview with diagram
9. [Primary Pipeline Update Plan](primary_pipeline_update_plan.md) - Plan for updating the primary pipeline

## Key Implementation Components

The implementation consists of the following key components:

1. **SQL Script Modification**: Modify all SQL scripts to use the new table naming convention
2. **Backward Compatibility Views**: Create views with the old table names that point to the new tables
3. **Pipeline Runner Modification**: Update the pipeline runner to use the modified scripts
4. **Testing**: Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly
5. **Code Reference Updates**: Update all code references to use the new table names
6. **Documentation and Deployment**: Update all documentation and deploy the implementation

## Primary Pipeline Considerations

The primary pipeline (`run_boundary_hexagon_layer_enhanced_pipeline.py`) will be updated to support both the old and new table naming conventions. This ensures a smooth transition while maintaining backward compatibility.

Key changes to the primary pipeline:

1. Add a `--use-renamed-tables` flag to control whether to use the renamed tables
2. Update the `run_pipeline` function to use the renamed SQL scripts when the flag is set
3. Create a wrapper script for the renamed tables pipeline

## Implementation Path Forward

### Phase 1: SQL Script Modification (Days 1-4)

1. Create the `renamed` directory in `epsg3857_pipeline/core/sql/`
2. Modify each SQL script to use the new table naming convention
3. Create the backward compatibility views script

#### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ `01_extract_water_features_3857.sql` - Completed
- ‚úÖ `02_create_water_buffers_3857.sql` - Completed
- üîÑ `03_dissolve_water_buffers_3857.sql` - In Progress
- üìù `04_create_terrain_grid_boundary_hexagon.sql` - Planned
- üìù `04a_create_terrain_edges_hexagon.sql` - Planned
- üìù `05_create_boundary_nodes_hexagon.sql` - Planned
- üìù `06_create_boundary_edges_hexagon_enhanced.sql` - Planned
- üìù `07_create_unified_boundary_graph_hexagon.sql` - Planned
- ‚úÖ `create_backward_compatibility_views.sql` - Completed

### Phase 2: Pipeline Runner Modification (Day 5)

1. Update the primary pipeline to support both the old and new table naming conventions
2. Create a wrapper script for the renamed tables pipeline
3. Test the updated pipeline

### Phase 3: Testing (Days 6-9)

1. Create and run unit tests for each script
2. Create and run integration tests for the entire pipeline
3. Create and run backward compatibility tests
4. Create and run performance tests
5. Fix any issues that arise

### Phase 4: Code Reference Updates (Days 10-12)

1. Identify all code that references the old table names
2. Update the code to use the new table names
3. Test the updated code

### Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment (Days 13-14)

1. Update all documentation to use the new table names
2. Create a deployment plan
3. Deploy the implementation
4. Monitor the deployment for any issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete the modification of `03_dissolve_water_buffers_3857.sql`
2. Begin the modification of `04_create_terrain_grid_boundary_hexagon.sql`
3. Update the primary pipeline to support both the old and new table naming conventions
4. Create a wrapper script for the renamed tables pipeline
5. Begin creating unit tests for the modified scripts

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach for implementing the Pipeline Stage Prefixing naming convention. By following this plan, we can ensure a smooth transition to the new naming convention while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.

The implementation will be completed over a 14-day period, with careful testing to ensure that the new naming convention works correctly and does not introduce any issues. The primary pipeline will be updated to support both the old and new table naming conventions, providing a smooth transition path.

By implementing this naming convention, we will improve the organization and maintainability of the codebase, making it easier to understand and work with the pipeline.
