# Table Naming Implementation Timeline

This document outlines the timeline for implementing the Pipeline Stage Prefixing naming convention.

## Overview

The implementation will be completed over a 14-day period, with careful testing to ensure that the new naming convention works correctly and does not introduce any issues. The timeline is divided into five phases:

1. SQL Script Modification (Days 1-4)
2. Pipeline Runner Modification (Day 5)
3. Testing (Days 6-9)
4. Code Reference Updates (Days 10-12)
5. Documentation and Deployment (Days 13-14)

## Detailed Timeline

### Phase 1: SQL Script Modification (Days 1-4)

#### Day 1: Setup and Initial Scripts

- Create the `renamed` directory in `epsg3857_pipeline/core/sql/`
- Modify `01_extract_water_features_3857.sql`
- Modify `02_create_water_buffers_3857.sql`
- Create the backward compatibility views script

#### Day 2: Middle Scripts

- Modify `03_dissolve_water_buffers_3857.sql`
- Modify `04_create_terrain_grid_boundary_hexagon.sql`
- Modify `04a_create_terrain_edges_hexagon.sql`

#### Day 3: Later Scripts

- Modify `05_create_boundary_nodes_hexagon.sql`
- Modify `06_create_boundary_edges_hexagon_enhanced.sql`

#### Day 4: Final Scripts

- Modify `07_create_unified_boundary_graph_hexagon.sql`
- Review all modified scripts
- Fix any issues

### Phase 2: Pipeline Runner Modification (Day 5)

#### Day 5: Pipeline Runner

- Update the primary pipeline to support both the old and new table naming conventions
- Create a wrapper script for the renamed tables pipeline
- Test the updated pipeline

### Phase 3: Testing (Days 6-9)

#### Day 6: Unit Testing

- Create unit tests for each script
- Run unit tests
- Fix any issues

#### Day 7: Integration Testing

- Create integration tests for the entire pipeline
- Run integration tests
- Fix any issues

#### Day 8: Backward Compatibility Testing

- Create backward compatibility tests
- Run backward compatibility tests
- Fix any issues

#### Day 9: Performance Testing

- Create performance tests
- Run performance tests
- Fix any issues

### Phase 4: Code Reference Updates (Days 10-12)

#### Day 10: Core Pipeline Code

- Identify all code that references the old table names
- Update the core pipeline code to use the new table names
- Test the updated code

#### Day 11: Visualization and Analysis Code

- Update visualization and analysis code to use the new table names
- Test the updated code

#### Day 12: Tests and Documentation

- Update tests to use the new table names
- Update documentation to use the new table names
- Test the updated code

### Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment (Days 13-14)

#### Day 13: Final Documentation

- Update all documentation to use the new table names
- Create a deployment plan
- Create a rollback plan

#### Day 14: Deployment

- Deploy the implementation
- Monitor the deployment for any issues
- Fix any issues

## Dependencies

The following dependencies exist between the phases:

1. SQL Script Modification must be completed before Pipeline Runner Modification
2. Pipeline Runner Modification must be completed before Testing
3. Testing must be completed before Code Reference Updates
4. Code Reference Updates must be completed before Documentation and Deployment

## Resources

The following resources are required for the implementation:

1. Development Environment
   - Docker environment with PostgreSQL and PostGIS
   - Python environment with required packages

2. Test Data
   - Sample OSM data for testing
   - Existing database with the old table structure for comparison

3. Documentation
   - Table naming convention documentation
   - SQL script modification approach
   - Implementation plan

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Complex SQL Scripts

**Risk**: Some SQL scripts may be complex and difficult to modify.

**Mitigation**: Break down the modification into smaller steps, test each step.

### Risk 2: Dependencies Between Scripts

**Risk**: Changes in one script may affect other scripts.

**Mitigation**: Test the entire pipeline after modifying each script.

### Risk 3: Performance Issues

**Risk**: The new naming convention may introduce performance issues.

**Mitigation**: Monitor performance during testing, optimize as needed.

### Risk 4: Backward Compatibility Issues

**Risk**: Existing code may not work correctly with the backward compatibility views.

**Mitigation**: Thoroughly test backward compatibility, create INSTEAD OF triggers if needed.

## Communication Plan

### Daily Updates

- Provide daily updates on progress
- Document any issues or challenges encountered
- Update the implementation plan as needed

### Code Reviews

- Request code reviews for modified scripts
- Address feedback promptly

### Documentation Updates

- Update documentation to reflect changes
- Ensure all team members are aware of the changes

## Conclusion

This timeline provides a comprehensive plan for implementing the Pipeline Stage Prefixing naming convention. By following this timeline, we can ensure a smooth transition to the new naming convention while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
