# Table Naming Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Pipeline Stage Prefixing naming convention implementation.

## Testing Objectives

The testing strategy has the following objectives:

1. Verify that the modified SQL scripts work correctly
2. Verify that the backward compatibility views work correctly
3. Verify that the updated pipeline works correctly with both the old and new table naming conventions
4. Verify that existing code continues to work with the new naming convention
5. Verify that the performance of the pipeline is not significantly affected by the new naming convention

## Testing Phases

The testing will be conducted in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Unit Testing

Unit tests will be created for each modified SQL script to verify that it works correctly in isolation.

#### Test Cases

For each modified SQL script, the following test cases will be created:

1. **Table Creation**: Verify that the script creates the expected tables with the correct structure
2. **Data Integrity**: Verify that the script populates the tables with the correct data
3. **Spatial Indexes**: Verify that the script creates the expected spatial indexes
4. **Error Handling**: Verify that the script handles errors correctly

#### Implementation

The unit tests will be implemented as follows:

1. Create a test script for each modified SQL script
2. Reset the database to a clean state before each test
3. Run the script and verify the results
4. Log the test results

### Phase 2: Integration Testing

Integration tests will be created to verify that the entire pipeline works correctly with the modified SQL scripts.

#### Test Cases

The following test cases will be created:

1. **Full Pipeline**: Run the entire pipeline with the modified SQL scripts and verify that it completes successfully
2. **Table Relationships**: Verify that the relationships between tables are maintained correctly
3. **Data Consistency**: Verify that the data in the tables is consistent with the expected results
4. **Pipeline Performance**: Measure the performance of the pipeline with the modified SQL scripts

#### Implementation

The integration tests will be implemented as follows:

1. Create a test script for the entire pipeline
2. Reset the database to a clean state before each test
3. Run the pipeline with the modified SQL scripts
4. Verify the results
5. Log the test results

### Phase 3: Backward Compatibility Testing

Backward compatibility tests will be created to verify that existing code continues to work with the new naming convention.

#### Test Cases

The following test cases will be created:

1. **View Queries**: Verify that queries using the views return the same results as queries using the new tables
2. **Existing Code**: Run existing code that uses the old table names and verify that it works correctly
3. **Write Operations**: If applicable, verify that write operations on the views correctly update the underlying tables

#### Implementation

The backward compatibility tests will be implemented as follows:

1. Create a test script for backward compatibility
2. Reset the database to a clean state before each test
3. Run the pipeline with the modified SQL scripts
4. Run queries using both the views and the new tables, and compare the results
5. Run existing code that uses the old table names and verify that it works correctly
6. Log the test results

### Phase 4: Performance Testing

Performance tests will be created to verify that the performance of the pipeline is not significantly affected by the new naming convention.

#### Test Cases

The following test cases will be created:

1. **Pipeline Execution Time**: Measure the execution time of the pipeline with both the old and new table naming conventions
2. **Query Performance**: Measure the performance of queries using both the views and the new tables
3. **Memory Usage**: Measure the memory usage of the pipeline with both the old and new table naming conventions

#### Implementation

The performance tests will be implemented as follows:

1. Create a test script for performance testing
2. Reset the database to a clean state before each test
3. Measure the performance of the pipeline with both the old and new table naming conventions
4. Measure the performance of queries using both the views and the new tables
5. Log the test results

## Test Environment

The tests will be run in a dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. This includes:

1. The same database schema
2. Similar data volumes
3. Similar hardware resources

## Test Data

The tests will use a combination of:

1. Real data from the production environment
2. Synthetic data generated specifically for testing

## Test Reporting

The test results will be reported in a standardized format that includes:

1. Test name
2. Test status (pass/fail)
3. Test duration
4. Any error messages
5. Performance metrics (if applicable)

## Test Automation

The tests will be automated using a combination of:

1. Python scripts for running the tests
2. SQL scripts for verifying the results
3. Shell scripts for orchestrating the tests

## Test Schedule

The tests will be run:

1. After each SQL script is modified
2. After the entire pipeline is updated
3. Before deploying to production
4. Periodically after deployment to ensure continued compatibility

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach for verifying that the Pipeline Stage Prefixing naming convention implementation works correctly and does not introduce any regressions. By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth transition to the new naming convention while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
