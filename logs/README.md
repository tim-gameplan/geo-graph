# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by various components of the terrain system.

## Structure

- `*.log`: Log files from the root-level scripts
- `epsg3857_pipeline/`: Log files from the EPSG:3857 pipeline scripts
  - `*.log`: Log files from the pipeline scripts
  - `epsg3857_pipeline/logs/`: Original log directory for the pipeline scripts

## Log Rotation

Log files are not automatically rotated or cleaned up. You may want to periodically clean up old log files to prevent disk space issues.
