# Voronoi Connection Strategies: A Comprehensive Overview

This document provides a detailed technical overview of different connection strategies for connecting terrain grid points to water obstacle boundaries in the EPSG:3857 Terrain Graph Pipeline.

## Introduction

In terrain graph generation, one of the key challenges is creating appropriate connections between the terrain grid and water obstacle boundaries. These connections are critical for:

1. Ensuring graph connectivity
2. Enabling realistic navigation around water obstacles
3. Providing optimal pathfinding options
4. Creating a natural-looking graph representation

This document examines four different connection strategies, each with its own advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.

## 1. Simple Nearest Neighbor Strategy

### Description

The Simple Nearest Neighbor strategy is the most straightforward approach: for each terrain point near a water boundary, find the closest boundary node and create a connection.

### Implementation

```sql
-- For each terrain point, find the closest boundary node
SELECT 
    tp.id AS terrain_point_id,
    bn.node_id AS boundary_node_id,
    ST_Distance(tp.geom, bn.geom) AS distance,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY tp.id 
        ORDER BY ST_Distance(tp.geom, bn.geom)
    ) AS rank
FROM 
    terrain_points tp
CROSS JOIN 
    boundary_nodes bn
WHERE 
    tp.hex_type = 'boundary'
```

### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Performance**: Computationally efficient, especially for small datasets
- **Robustness**: Less prone to geometry errors or edge cases

### Disadvantages

- **Uneven Distribution**: Some boundary nodes may receive many connections while others receive none
- **Suboptimal Connections**: Connections may not be to the most relevant part of the boundary
- **Clustering**: Connections tend to cluster around certain boundary nodes, creating bottlenecks

### Use Cases

- Small datasets with simple water obstacles
- When computational efficiency is a priority
- As a fallback strategy when more complex approaches fail

## 2. Line-to-Point Connection Strategy

### Description

The Line-to-Point Connection strategy connects each terrain point to the closest point on the water obstacle boundary itself, rather than to pre-existing boundary nodes. This creates more direct and meaningful connections to the actual boundary.

### Implementation

```sql
-- For each terrain point, find the closest point on the water obstacle boundary
SELECT 
    tp.id AS terrain_point_id,
    ST_ClosestPoint(wo.geom, tp.geom) AS closest_point,
    ST_Distance(tp.geom, wo.geom) AS distance,
    ST_MakeLine(tp.geom, ST_ClosestPoint(wo.geom, tp.geom)) AS geom
FROM 
    terrain_points tp
CROSS JOIN 
    water_obstacles wo
WHERE 
    tp.hex_type = 'boundary'
```

### Advantages

- **Direct Connections**: Creates the most direct path to the water boundary
- **Precise Boundary Representation**: Connections accurately represent the closest point on the boundary
- **No Node Dependency**: Not limited by the distribution of pre-existing boundary nodes
- **Natural Appearance**: Connections look more natural and intuitive

### Disadvantages

- **Node Creation Complexity**: May require creating new boundary nodes at connection points
- **Potential Redundancy**: Multiple terrain points might connect to very similar locations on the boundary
- **Implementation Complexity**: More complex to implement in a full pipeline

### Use Cases

- When precise boundary representation is important
- For applications requiring the most direct paths to water boundaries
- When pre-existing boundary nodes don't provide adequate coverage

## 3. Standard Voronoi Connection Strategy

### Description

The Standard Voronoi Connection strategy uses Voronoi diagrams to partition space around boundary nodes. Each terrain point is connected to the boundary node whose Voronoi cell contains it. This creates a more even distribution of connections.

### Implementation

```sql
-- Create Voronoi cells for boundary nodes
WITH voronoi_polygons AS (
    SELECT ST_VoronoiPolygons(ST_Collect(geom)) AS geom
    FROM boundary_nodes
),
voronoi_dump AS (
    SELECT (ST_Dump(geom)).geom AS cell_geom
    FROM voronoi_polygons
)
SELECT 
    bn.node_id AS boundary_node_id,
    vd.cell_geom
FROM 
    voronoi_dump vd
JOIN 
    boundary_nodes bn
    ON ST_Contains(vd.cell_geom, bn.geom);

-- Connect terrain points to the boundary node whose Voronoi cell they fall within
SELECT 
    tp.id AS terrain_point_id,
    vc.boundary_node_id,
    ST_Distance(tp.geom, bn.geom) AS distance,
    ST_MakeLine(tp.geom, bn.geom) AS geom
FROM 
    terrain_points tp
JOIN 
    voronoi_cells vc ON ST_Intersects(vc.cell_geom, tp.geom)
JOIN 
    boundary_nodes bn ON bn.node_id = vc.boundary_node_id
WHERE 
    tp.hex_type = 'boundary';
```

### Advantages

- **Even Distribution**: More evenly distributes connections across boundary nodes
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Uses spatial relationships to determine connections
- **Reduced Clustering**: Prevents excessive clustering of connections at certain boundary nodes
- **Balanced Load**: Each boundary node receives a more balanced number of connections

### Disadvantages

- **Geometry Errors**: Voronoi diagram generation can encounter errors with complex geometries
- **Performance Issues**: More computationally expensive than simpler approaches
- **Not Always Optimal**: Connections may not always be to the closest boundary node
- **Boundary Effects**: Voronoi cells at the edges of the dataset may be very large

### Use Cases

- When even distribution of connections is important
- For medium to large datasets with many boundary nodes
- When preventing connection clustering is a priority

## 4. Reversed Voronoi Connection Strategy

### Description

The Reversed Voronoi Connection strategy flips the traditional approach by creating Voronoi cells for boundary terrain points instead of boundary nodes. This "reversed" approach results in more natural connections and better distribution of connections across water boundaries.

### Implementation

```sql
-- Create Voronoi cells for boundary terrain points
WITH boundary_terrain_points AS (
    SELECT id, geom
    FROM terrain_points
    WHERE hex_type = 'boundary'
),
voronoi_polygons AS (
    SELECT ST_VoronoiPolygons(ST_Collect(geom)) AS geom
    FROM boundary_terrain_points
),
voronoi_dump AS (
    SELECT (ST_Dump(geom)).geom AS cell_geom
    FROM voronoi_polygons
)
SELECT 
    btp.id AS terrain_point_id,
    vd.cell_geom
FROM 
    voronoi_dump vd
JOIN 
    boundary_terrain_points btp
    ON ST_Contains(vd.cell_geom, btp.geom);

-- Connect boundary terrain points to boundary nodes that fall within their Voronoi cells
SELECT 
    vc.terrain_point_id,
    bn.node_id AS boundary_node_id,
    ST_Distance(tp.geom, bn.geom) AS distance,
    ST_MakeLine(tp.geom, bn.geom) AS geom
FROM 
    reversed_voronoi_cells vc
JOIN 
    boundary_nodes bn ON ST_Intersects(vc.cell_geom, bn.geom)
JOIN 
    terrain_points tp ON tp.id = vc.terrain_point_id;
```

### Advantages

- **Most Natural Connections**: Creates the most natural-looking connections between terrain and water
- **Better Distribution**: Connections are more evenly distributed across water boundaries
- **Terrain-Centric Approach**: Focuses on terrain points claiming boundary nodes, which is more intuitive
- **Reduced Geometry Errors**: Less prone to geometry errors than the standard Voronoi approach
- **Better Performance**: Processing boundary terrain points (which are typically fewer than boundary nodes) can be more efficient

### Disadvantages

- **Complex Implementation**: Most complex of all the approaches
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Results can be sensitive to the distribution of terrain points
- **Potential for Disconnected Nodes**: Some boundary nodes might not be connected to any terrain point

### Use Cases

- When most natural-looking connections are a priority
- For complex water boundaries with irregular shapes
- When optimal connection distribution is critical
- For applications requiring the most realistic visual representation

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Complexity

The computational complexity of each strategy varies:

1. **Nearest Neighbor**: O(T * B) where T is the number of terrain points and B is the number of boundary nodes
2. **Line-to-Point**: O(T * W) where W is the complexity of the water obstacle geometry
3. **Standard Voronoi**: O(B log B + T * B) for Voronoi diagram generation and point-in-polygon tests
4. **Reversed Voronoi**: O(T log T + B * T) for Voronoi diagram generation and point-in-polygon tests

### Memory Usage

Memory usage also varies:

1. **Nearest Neighbor**: Low - only stores distances between points
2. **Line-to-Point**: Medium - stores closest points on boundaries
3. **Standard Voronoi**: High - stores Voronoi cells for each boundary node
4. **Reversed Voronoi**: High - stores Voronoi cells for each boundary terrain point

### Optimization Techniques

Several optimization techniques can improve performance:

1. **Spatial Indexing**: Use spatial indexes to speed up distance calculations and point-in-polygon tests
2. **Distance Limiting**: Only consider points within a maximum distance
3. **Chunked Processing**: Process points in chunks to avoid memory issues
4. **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel processing for large datasets
5. **Simplified Geometries**: Use simplified geometries for Voronoi diagram generation

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Geometry Errors in Voronoi Diagram Generation

Voronoi diagram generation can encounter geometry errors, especially with complex or irregular point distributions:

```
ERROR: GEOSVoronoiDiagram: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 2 - must be 0 or >= 4
```

**Solutions**:
1. Use a buffer-based approach instead of true Voronoi diagrams
2. Process points in smaller batches
3. Add a small jitter to points to avoid collinearity
4. Use a fallback strategy when Voronoi generation fails

### Handling Water Crossings

Connections should not cross through water obstacles:

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the connection line intersects with water obstacles
2. Use ST_Crosses to detect intersections
3. Reject connections that cross through water obstacles

```sql
-- Ensure the connection line doesn't cross through the water obstacle
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM water_obstacles wo
    WHERE ST_Crosses(ST_MakeLine(tp.geom, bn.geom), wo.geom)
)
```

### Boundary Effects

Voronoi cells at the edges of the dataset may be very large or extend beyond the area of interest:

**Solutions**:
1. Clip Voronoi cells to a bounding box
2. Add dummy points around the perimeter of the dataset
3. Limit the maximum size of Voronoi cells

```sql
-- Clip Voronoi cells to a bounding box
UPDATE voronoi_cells
SET cell_geom = ST_Intersection(cell_geom, ST_Buffer(
    (SELECT ST_Extent(geom) FROM boundary_nodes),
    1000
));
```

## Practical Recommendations

### Strategy Selection Guidelines

Choose the appropriate strategy based on your specific requirements:

1. **Nearest Neighbor**: Use for small datasets, simple water obstacles, or as a fallback strategy
2. **Line-to-Point**: Use when precise boundary representation is important
3. **Standard Voronoi**: Use when even distribution of connections is important
4. **Reversed Voronoi**: Use when most natural-looking connections are a priority

### Parameter Tuning

Tune parameters based on your specific dataset:

1. **Maximum Connection Distance**: Adjust based on the density of terrain points and boundary nodes
2. **Boundary Node Spacing**: Adjust based on the complexity of water obstacles
3. **Voronoi Cell Size**: Adjust based on the distribution of points
4. **Connection Limits**: Limit the number of connections per terrain point or boundary node

### Hybrid Approaches

Consider hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of different strategies:

1. **Nearest Neighbor + Line-to-Point**: Use Line-to-Point for primary connections and Nearest Neighbor as a fallback
2. **Voronoi + Distance Limiting**: Use Voronoi cells but limit connections to a maximum distance
3. **Reversed Voronoi + Connection Balancing**: Use Reversed Voronoi but balance the number of connections per boundary node

## Conclusion

Each connection strategy has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of strategy depends on the specific requirements of your application. The Reversed Voronoi Connection Strategy generally provides the most natural-looking connections and best distribution, but it is also the most complex to implement. For simpler applications, the Nearest Neighbor or Line-to-Point strategies may be sufficient.

By understanding the technical details and trade-offs of each strategy, you can make an informed decision about which approach is best for your specific use case.
